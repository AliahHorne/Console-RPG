### Instructions
There are a collection of videos on Schoology for you to follow along with in order to create your Console RPG. The videos are put in order of how you should watch them, since some of them build on each other, but generally, I try to keep each one as self-contained as possible. Each one goes over a different aspect of the Console RPG which will be graded separately from each other, as outlined below. If you want to add a story to your Console RPG, feel free, but it won't be part of the grade. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone's at the end of the unit! Also, if you don't feel like you need to follow along with the videos and want to challenge yourself to do at least some things without them, I'm just putting that out there.

### Grading Rubric
Your Console RPG must have 8 unique systems in the game, each outlined below. Once all are complete, you will have a finished game that you can play and show off to your friends! Each of the 8 unique systems contributes 15 points to your total score of 120 points on this assignment. You get the points if the system is fully functional, without bugs or glitches. Make sure to test your code! Also, each one has an extra credit opportunity listed below (the point values that start with a +).
